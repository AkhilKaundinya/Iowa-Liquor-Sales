## Problem Statement
### Introduction
The repository focuses on analyzing spirits purchase information from Iowa Class "E" liquor licensees between January 1, 2012, and the present date. The dataset provides valuable insights into total spirits sales in Iowa, allowing for a granular examination of individual products at the store level. Class E liquor licenses are granted to commercial establishments like grocery stores, liquor stores, and convenience stores, enabling them to sell liquor for off-premises consumption in original unopened containers.

### Business Understanding
The Iowa Liquor Sales dataset presents a unique opportunity to delve into the patterns and trends of liquor sales in Iowa. By understanding the sales performance of different liquor products across various Class E liquor license holders, we can gain valuable insights into consumer preferences and market demands. Analyzing sales data at the store level enables us to identify top-selling products, regional variations, and potential growth opportunities. These insights can inform inventory management decisions, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts to optimize profitability for both licensees and suppliers.
